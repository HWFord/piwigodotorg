Rewritten user manager, redesigned plugin manager, added activity viewer are some obvious changes you will see right away.

2) When you activated a new plugin, the screen reloaded, and you had to search in the list for the newly activated plugin, in order to access its settings. This was not very practical, especially for photo libraries with many plugins. With  Piwigo 12, a single click activates the plugin, and then you can directly modify its settings.
